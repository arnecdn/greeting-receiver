# Greeting app in Rust
This is a simple sample app implementing a service for receiving greetings and storing them in a kafka topic.

It implements an API for receiving and listing greetings. 
The service publishes events from new greetings downstream for consumers. 



# Building docker image
In order to build a dockerimage, the following init was done. 
```
docker init
docker-compose up --build
```

The basic setup didn't build correctly due to cross compilation from macos to alpine

The following sections steps through problems and solutions  
## Updating versions, due to errors bulding
After troubleshooting building docker image, 
Update rust version: 
```
rustup update
```
## Cross compiliation of rdkafka dependencies 
Building the docker image failed with some errors refering to cross compliation of
rdkafka-sys dependencies. 

Added to the "# Install host build dependencies."  
```
#RUN apk add --no-cache clang lld musl-dev git librdkafka-dev g++ make
```


After some work making Dockerfile build a successfull image, the container refused to run. 
In order to investiage, I installed the utility strace in order to trace the linux environment
for clues. 
By reading output, it was pretty easy to relate errors to missing files and external resources not accessible. 


# Deploying image to minikube from local development
In order to deploy a locally built image from local docker registry follow steps for macos:


```
TAG="0.29" 
docker build -q -t "arnecdn/greeting-rust:${TAG}" . &&
mkdir -p .docker && docker image save -o .docker/greeting-rust.tar "arnecdn/greeting-rust:${TAG}" &&
minikube image load .docker/greeting-rust.tar
```
From minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/
```
Remember to turn off the imagePullPolicy:Always 
(use imagePullPolicy:IfNotPresent or imagePullPolicy:Never) 
in your yaml file. Otherwise Kubernetes wonâ€™t use your locally build image and 
it will pull from the network.
```

Further deployment includes installing additional services on Minikube as Kafka, Kafka-Connect and Postgres. 
The specs are stored in ./kubernetes/ folder and can be deployed as a unit.
Make sure the image of rust-docker is available for minikube. See section over. 
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/greeting-rust.yaml
```
